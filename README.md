## Getting Started

If you're completely new to Jekyll, I recommend checking out the documentation at <http://jekyllrb.com> or there's a tutorial by [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).

### Installing Jekyll

If you don't have Jekyll already installed, you will need to go ahead and do that.

```
$ gem install jekyll
```

#### Verify your Jekyll version

It's important to also check your version of Jekyll since this project uses Native Sass which
is [only supported by 2.0+](http://jekyllrb.com/news/2014/05/06/jekyll-turns-2-0-0/).

```
$ jekyll -v
# This should be jekyll 2.0.0 or later
```

### Fork, then clone

Fork the repo, and then clone it so you've got the code locally.

### Modify the _config.yml

The `_config.yml` located in the root of the Pixyll directory contains all of the configuration details
for the Jekyll site.

### Jekyll Serve

Then, start the Jekyll Server. I always like to give the `--watch` option so it updates the generated HTML when I make changes.

```
$ jekyll serve --watch
```

Now you can navigate to `localhost:4000` in your browser to see the site.

### Using Github Pages

You can host your Jekyll site for free with Github Pages. [Click here](https://pages.github.com/) for more information.
